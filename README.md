## <h1>Water Jug Challenge</h1>ü´ó

</p>RESTful API:
‚Ä¢ Develop endpoints to accept jug capacities (X and Y) and the target volume (Z) as inputs.
‚Ä¢ Ensure the API strictly adheres to REST principles with appropriate use of HTTP 
methods.
‚Ä¢ Responses must be provided in JSON format detailing the sequence of actions to solve 
the riddle or indicating if no solution is possible.</p>

<p>Algorithm Implementation:
‚Ä¢Implement an algorithm that determines the sequence of steps needed to measure 
exactly Z gallons, if feasible.
‚Ä¢The solution must consider the actions: Fill, Empty, and Transfer (between the two jugs 
only).</p>

<p>Performance Considerations:
‚Ä¢ Optimize the algorithm for quick response times, especially considering the potential for 
large input values.</p>

<p>Error Handling and Validation:
‚Ä¢ Validate input to ensure X, Y, and Z are positive integers.
‚Ä¢ Return meaningful error messages in JSON format if inputs are invalid or if no solution 
can be found.</p>

<p>Testing:
‚Ä¢ Create unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm.
‚Ä¢ Include integration tests to ensure the API handles requests and responses correctl</p>
